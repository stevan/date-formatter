Revision history for Perl extension Date-Formatter.

0.09 Thurs. May 17, 2007
    - get rid of some annoying test failures which 
      are caused by Test::More upgrades, they were
      totally harmless, but I am getting sick of 
      typing `force install ...` in the CPAN prompt
      all the time ;)

0.08 Fri  Aug 26 2005
    - Added localization support via DateTime::Locale

0.07 Tues Nov 30 2004
    - forgot to add the new test to the MANIFEST
    - forgot to add the date to the Changes file

0.06 Tues Nov 30 2004
    - added the options to set a date from the 
      constructor which uses Time::Local::timelocal() 
      to construct the new date
    - added Time::Local as a dependency
    - added requirement of minimum of perl 5.6.0

0.05 Thurs Nov 18 2004
    - now using Scalar::Util::blessed() instead of 
      the convoluted UNIVERSAL::isa() stuff. 
      - added Scalar::Util as a dependency
    - added pod.t and pod_coverage.t

0.04  Sun May 2 2004
    - Tests for time based modules are touchy. Another test was
      failing because I again made an assumption that did not
      pan out. Hopefully this will fix it now. 

0.03  Tues April 14, 2004
    - The first test was failing, it was not due to an error
	  in the module, but instead an error in the tests. I was
	  calculating the number of hours till a certain time, so
	  I would maniplate certain blocks of code and test them. 
	  My test calculations were flawed, so it was not correctly 
	  setting the hours for the test.

0.02  Tues April 13, 2004
    - the documentation was a little wonky, so I cleaned it up
	  nothing much else was changed though.
